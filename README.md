# Passing Cars Counting

This project demonstrates a car counting system using **YOLOv8**, **SORT tracker**, and **OpenCV**. It processes video footage to detect and count passing vehicles (cars, buses, trucks, and motorbikes) across a predefined line.

---

## Features
- **Vehicle Detection**: Utilizes YOLOv8 for real-time object detection.
- **Vehicle Tracking**: Tracks detected vehicles using the SORT algorithm.
- **Customizable Regions**: Includes masking and detection line setup.
- **Dynamic Counting**: Tracks and counts vehicles crossing a specific boundary.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **YOLOv8**: Object detection framework from [Ultralytics](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics).
- **SORT**: Simple Online and Realtime Tracking for object tracking.
- **OpenCV**: For video processing and drawing bounding boxes.
- **Python**: Programming language for implementation.
